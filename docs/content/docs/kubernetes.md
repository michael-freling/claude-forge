title: Kubernetes Access

When `kubernetes.enabled` is set, claude-forge runs a shared Kubernetes MCP
server that Claude Code can use to inspect and operate on your cluster. Access
is constrained by RBAC rather than by disabling destructive operations — the
agent's permissions are exactly what you grant its service account.

Generate the ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding (with safe
carveouts — no secrets, no exec, no RBAC tampering) and apply them:

```bash
claude-forge kube render --context dev | kubectl apply -f -
```

See the `kubernetes` section of the
[configuration reference]({{< relref "/docs/configuration" >}}) for the
available options.
